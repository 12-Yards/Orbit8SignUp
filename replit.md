## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter (lightweight alternative to React Router)
- **State Management**: TanStack React Query for server state
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui component library built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS variables for theming (light/dark mode support)
- **Build Tool**: Vite with custom plugins for Replit development experience
- **Color Theme**: Blue (#0ea5e9 sky) and Green (#22c55e emerald) for branding

The frontend follows a component-based architecture with:
- Pages in `client/src/pages/` (home.tsx, login.tsx, create-account.tsx, contact.tsx, feature.tsx, benefit.tsx, admin.tsx, admin-login.tsx, not-found.tsx)
- Reusable UI components in `client/src/components/ui/`
- Custom hooks in `client/src/hooks/`
- Utility functions and query client in `client/src/lib/`

### Routing Structure
- `/` - Home page (marketing landing page)
- `/login` - Login page (Organisers Login form with back button)
- `/create-account` - Account creation page (5-step onboarding, data saved to DB)
- `/contact` - Contact page (form with Organisation, Name, Email, Mobile, Notes, data saved to DB)
- `/admin/login` - Admin login page (username: admin)
- `/admin` - Admin dashboard (view registrations and contact submissions, edit Platform/Admin URLs)
- `/features/:slug` - Feature detail pages (6 total)
- `/benefits/:slug` - Benefit detail pages (5 total)
- Feature slugs: member-communication, groups-communities, events-competitions, reciprocal-play, content-publishing, analytics-reporting
- Benefit slugs: member-engagement, simplify-management, inter-club-play, revenue-streams, improve-retention

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Express 5 on Node.js
- **Language**: TypeScript with ESM modules
- **API Pattern**: RESTful API with `/api` prefix for all routes
- **Storage Interface**: Abstracted storage layer (`IStorage` interface) allowing swappable implementations

The backend structure:
- `server/index.ts` - Application entry point with middleware setup
- `server/routes.ts` - API route registration
- `server/storage.ts` - Data access layer with storage interface
- `server/vite.ts` - Development server integration with Vite HMR
- `server/static.ts` - Production static file serving

### Database Layer
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL dialect
- **Schema**: Defined in `shared/schema.ts` using Drizzle's type-safe schema builder
- **Validation**: Zod schemas generated from Drizzle schemas via `drizzle-zod`
- **Migrations**: Managed via `drizzle-kit` with migrations output to `./migrations`

### Shared Code
The `shared/` directory contains code shared between frontend and backend:
- Database schema definitions
- TypeScript types derived from schema
- Zod validation schemas

### Build System
- **Development**: Vite dev server with HMR, proxied through Express
- **Production Build**: Custom build script (`script/build.ts`) using:
  - Vite for client bundle (output to `dist/public`)
  - esbuild for server bundle (output to `dist/index.cjs`)
  - Selective dependency bundling to optimize cold start times

## External Dependencies

### Database
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database (configured via `DATABASE_URL` environment variable)
- **connect-pg-simple**: Session storage for Express sessions

### Core Libraries
- **Drizzle ORM**: Type-safe database queries and schema management
- **Zod**: Runtime type validation
- **TanStack React Query**: Async state management and caching

### UI Framework
- **Radix UI**: Unstyled, accessible component primitives
- **shadcn/ui**: Pre-built component patterns using Radix + Tailwind
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **Lucide React**: Icon library

### Development Tools
- **Vite**: Frontend build tool and dev server
- **esbuild**: Fast JavaScript/TypeScript bundler for server
- **TypeScript**: Static type checking across the stack
